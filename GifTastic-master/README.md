# GifTastic
A dynamic webpage that populates with gifs using the GIPHY API, as well as Javascript and Jquery to change the HTML, and CSS.

The page loads with several buttons that have gif categories to choose from. The theme of this gif page is characters from Nintendo's Super Mario universe.
When you click a button, 10 gifs will load. When each gif is clicked, it will change from being still to being animated. When a user clicks a second time, the animation stops.
The user can also type in and add their own category buttons using the input bar on the right.
